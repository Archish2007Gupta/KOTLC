                                        Linh may be the soft spoken, easily blushing counterpart to her twin brother’s surly moods—but that doesn’t make her any less of a force to be reckoned with. In fact, she’s one of the most powerful characters in the series—which sometimes causes problems for her. But she’s moved beyond her days of being the Girl of Many Floods and is ready and willing to prove her incredible control whenever the need arises, whether it be with awe-inspiring tricks or life-saving rescues.

                                        <b>THE GIRL OF MANY FLOODS:</b> Elemental abilities are known for being overwhelming—and for Linh, the combination of manifesting so young, becoming a Hydrokinetic, and living in a house near the ocean proved to be an impossible combination. The water constantly called to her, and its draw became so strong that Linh was unable to resist, often with destructive consequences. Her first few floods were smaller, like <i>[LOCATION REDACTED FOR PRIVACY]</i> and <i>[LOCATION REDACTED FOR PRIVACY]</i> . But the problem escalated in <i>[LOCATION REDACTED FOR SECURITY]</i> . Then her parents made the unfortunate mistake of bringing her to Atlantis. Linh’s flood nearly destroyed the underwater city, and the Councillors felt they had to intervene. After a rushed Tribunal, a unanimous Council voted to banish Linh in order to “preserve the safety of the Lost Cities.” And despite Linh’s young age, Linh’s parents (Quan and Mai Song) chose not to fight the decision—much to the fury of Linh’s twin brother (Tam), who was convinced the Council would’ve given a different ruling if his parents had sworn to make changes (like moving Linh somewhere with less water exposure and hiring her a full-time ability tutor) to keep Linh’s hydrokinesis under better control.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>A BOND UNLIKE ANY OTHER:</b> Linh was banished alone, and given her age and skill set at the time, it seems unlikely that she would’ve been able to survive for long. Fortunately for Linh, her twin brother (Tam) chose to go with her—despite her adamant protests that he shouldn’t give up his life. Reports indicate that Tam insisted they would be better off together—and that he would rather be with her than without her. Which is a true testimony to the connection between these two siblings. For all the judgment that gets cast on twins, it’s strange that no one seems to value the bond that children from multiple births have with each other. Tam and Linh are not the only example, but they are an excellent testimony of love, respect, and compassion that truly cannot be compared.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>A SILVER REMINDER:</b> In a similar vein to her brother, Linh’s long jet-black hair is tipped with silver—and it seems safe to assume that the metal was applied the same way (by melting down the chain of her registry pendant and dipping the ends of her hair into the molten silver). But in Linh’s case, the style was not meant to be a protest. Instead, Linh has explained that her “look” was intended as a reminder to herself of what can happen when she loses control of her hydrokinesis, and likely motivates her to hone her power.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>NEW FRIENDS:</b> After Linh’s banishment, it appears that Tam had no intention of trusting anyone ever again. But Linh refused to let her time in Exillium cause her to give up on the idea of friends. And when a new group of Waywards arrived rather suddenly—and one of them accidentally set their rope on fire during the dividing—Linh bravely used her ability to help douse the flames, even though it meant defying the coaches’ orders. She stepped back after that, observing as much as she could about these newcomers—and trying to convince her brother that making contact would be worth the risk—before finally reaching out to the one she’d helped that first day. The girl turned out to be Sophie Foster, who agreed to sneak away with Tam and Linh to learn more about them. And whether it was the fact that Sophie clearly didn’t judge Tam and Linh for being twins, or the strange color of her eyes (which surely proved that Sophie understood how it felt to be different), or the stories she told about trying to stop both the plague and an ongoing rebellion—or the fact that Tam’s reading of her shadowvapor showed noimmediate warning of danger—whatever it was, Tam and Linh opted to trust her. Soon after, Sophie introduced them to the rest of her group— which turned out to be a monumentally important shift for all of them. Tam and Linh found a new sort of family, as well as the means to return to the Lost Cities. The Black Swan acquired two vital allies. And all of them became true friends.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>A MASTER OF HER ABILITY:</b> Watching Linh’s hydrokinesis now makes it hard to believe that she ever struggled with control. Her aptitude with the ability is nothing short of amazing—particularly since she’s mostly self-trained. She’s learned to resist the water’s call unless it’s truly necessary for her to answer it. And she’s able to perform all manner of impressive feats—everything from entertaining tricks (like gathering small amounts of water into creative shapes) to lifting flowing rivers and bending them into an arch to allow someone to cross safely under. Technically, Linh has caused one additional flood since her banishment—but it most definitely was not a case of her losing control. She flooded Ravagog because it was the only way to get herself and her friends safely out of the ogre capital. Even the Council recognized the distinction, and instead of facing another Tribunal, both Tam and Linh were welcomed home to the Lost Cities—and granted admission to Foxfire. Linh now trains with a Hydrokinetic Mentor, and has even returned to Atlantis and managed to resist the pull of all that water. Control will never be easy for her—such is the challenge with elemental power. But Linh has reached a level of mastery that allows her to make it look easy.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>CAREGIVER—AND MORE:</b> When Wylie Endal was captured by the Neverseen—and then managed to escape—he returned to the Black Swan badly burned from what surely must’ve been a lengthy interrogation. Many might not have been able to face Wylie’s gruesome injuries, but Linh bravely stepped in to help, wrapping his scorched body in a cool water cocoon to draw out any remaining heat from his wounds. And when she’d done all she could for Wylie physically, she tended to his emotional recovery, visiting often and cheering him up with water tricks. (Apparently, he’s quite a fan of the water animals that Linh can make drift through the air.) And through of all those visits, Linh and Wylie became close friends—though some occasionally wonder if there might be more between them than friendship. That’s purespeculation, of course—and given the age gap between them (which is significant, since Linh has yet to register for the match), it also seems somewhat unlikely. All that’s known at this time is that Linh and Wylie do appear to spend a meaningful amount of time together.

                                        <b>A QUESTIONABLE CHOICE IN PET:</b> Much like Sophie, Linh appears to have a penchant for weirdly-cute-butunusually-challenging pets. In Linh’s case, she chose to adopt a murcat— despite Tam’s protests, and the fact that murcats are known for having large venomous fangs. Records indicate that the murcat is named Princess Purryfins, and it’s highly possible the name was chosen specifically to annoy her brother.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>THE GIRL WHO SAVED ATLANTIS:</b> While the above title has never officially been assigned to Linh, it’s definitely deserved. A few short years after losing control and flooding Atlantis (and ending up banished), Linh found the strength and confidence to stop the Neverseen from destroying the city. Yes, she did need Sophie to enhance her (which, it should be noted, was something that Linh had resisted before, out of fear that she might be overwhelmed by the craving). And Sophie, in turn, needed Keefe Sencen to help her focus. But even with Sophie and Keefe’s assistance, no one can deny that Linh was the true hero of that moment. Not only did she gather enough water to plug the tear that had been slashed into the city’s force field—but she also somehow managed to hold back the force of the ocean until the Council could send Psionipaths to make a permanent repair. Had Linh not been there, the city surely would’ve been lost—as would thousands of lives.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>SEPARATED—BUT STILL CONNECTED:</b> After everything Tam and Linh have fought through in order to stay together, it was particularly devastating when the twins recently found themselves ripped apart by the Neverseen. Lady Gisela forced Tam to surrender himself as a hostage in order to protect his sister and the baby alicorns. She also made it painfully clear that if anyone attempted to come after Tam, there would be severe consequences. And while many had doubts as to whether Tam would be able to remain loyal to the Black Swan —and to his principles—in that situation, Linh never doubted her brother for a second. She talked her friends out of planning a risky rescue, assuringthem that Tam could handle himself. And when she thought she’d found a way to help him and used her ability to contact him (with Sophie’s help), she wasn’t discouraged by the harsh things Tam said to convince her to abandon her plan. She trusted him so completely that she even followed his order and returned to Choralmere, despite her strained relationship with her parents. And when she snuck into Loamnore to help him escape, the sound of her voice helped Tam resist the bonds on his wrists that had been controlling him.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>FINAL NOTE:</b> Linh’s control of her ability remains remarkable—and yet it also seems clear that we still haven’t seen the full extent of her power. Whether that power will lead to salvation (as it did in Atlantis) or widespread destruction (like Ravagog) is yet to be determined. But it’s highly likely that it could be both.
