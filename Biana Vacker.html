                                        Biana may seem like the Princess of Foxfire Academy—but don’t let the perfect hair and fashionable clothes fool you. Beneath the make-up and perfectly coordinated accessories is a fearless fighter. And while she may not have manifested her special ability when we first meet her, that never stops her from taking on Fitz and Keefe in a game of base quest, (and no, it’s not just because she thinks Keefe is cute—though that definitely *does* help). She’s also an incredibly loyal friend—once she gets to know someone—and will do whatever it takes to protect the people she cares about.

                                        <b>THIRD CHILD:</b> Many may consider the following to be a touch scandalous, since it’s something that so rarely gets mentioned—but if this file were for someone in any other family, it would be a defining entry. Since Biana is a Vacker, there are hardly ever whispers of it—and yet, it should be noted that Biana Vacker is child number three for her parents, Alden and Della Vacker (though the inclusion of this note is in no way meant to cast any judgment). Since many in the Lost Cities fear that second children (and beyond) have weaker abilities and DNA, it’s generally rare for a family to have more than one child—and extremely rare to have more than two. Little is known about why Alden and Della chose to have a third child (again, since the subject is so rarely discussed). But one might speculate that they were hoping for a daughter. Whatever their reasoning, they definitely skirted convention and are quite fortunate that their family name protects them—and Biana—from facing the scorn they surely would have endured otherwise.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS:</b>Given Biana’s last name, the constant praise that was always showered on both of her brothers (though most of the praise was for Fitz), and the fact that she’s a third child—it’s safe to say that she’s had a lot to live up to. And like a true Vacker, her beauty, accent, and school performance have all been exceptional. But the real test came down to Biana’s manifesting. For years, gossip circles speculated about what ability the youngest Vacker might inherit from her legendary genetics, and whether it could possibly match that of her siblings. Biana did an excellent job of pretending not to notice the pressure she was facing (though she surely must have). And in the end, she outshone what everyone expected, manifesting as a Vanisher at an even younger age than Fitz manifested as a Telepath. And even with limited training, she’s proven herself to be incredibly adept at her ability, managing to vanish completely within hours of manifesting and holding her vanish for longer and longer periods of time. Records also suggest that when Biana teams up with Sophie Foster and allows Sophie to enhance her, she’s able to not only make herself invisible—but make others invisible as well. And while some may whisper about the irony of one of the most “watched” prodigies in the Lost Cities being able to literally disappear, others suspect that Biana may relish the anonymity her ability allows. There have also been numerous reports of Biana using her ability to eavesdrop on important conversations or sneak into places she otherwise wouldn’t be able to access, which has made her a valuable asset to the Black Swan and her friends.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>ALL IN THE FAMILY:</b> A primary goal of the matchmaking system is for each new generation to have increasingly powerful abilities. And while that isn’t always the case (much to the matchmakers’—and the Council’s—consternation), Biana’s family is a prime example of success. Like Biana, her mother (Della) is an incredibly powerful Vanisher (as is her brother Alvar, and it should also be noted that Fitz is a powerful Telepath, much like his father). But Biana seems to have also inherited her mother’s unique blend of grace, gumption, and ferocity. Reports indicate that Della’s received defensive battle training, and has combined the moves she’s learned with her vanishing to make her a true force to be reckoned with. And it appears she’s taught Biana (and Biana’s friends) how to protect themselves as well, which has allowed Biana to hold her own against some truly formidable enemies.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>STRUGGLING SOCIALITE:</b>While most Vackers tend to be effortlessly popular by reputation alone, Biana has not had the number of friends and acquaintances that one might expect. In fact, it would appear that she has developed some trepidation as to whether potential new friends are looking simply for access to her prominent family, or to find a way to connect with her brothers (particularly with Fitz, who has many admirers at Foxfire). This very concern offered an initial challenge to the development of Biana’s friendship with Sophie Foster when Sophie first moved to the Lost Cities. In fact, numerous reports paint Sophie and Biana’s initial relationship as adversarial—and when they first began spending more time together, it was apparently at Biana’s father’s (Alden’s) urging, which caused a fallout between them when Sophie discovered the truth. Ultimately, though, Biana and Sophie have grown to genuinely respect and admire each other, and are now well and truly friends. Biana has also made amends with others she’s neglected or lost touch with over time, including Maruca Chebota and Marella Redek.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>A NATURAL TRENDSETTER:</b> It of course helps that Biana’s family name, teal eyes, and incredible beauty make her a magnet for attention. But anyone who understands “style” knows that none of those things can give someone that additional headturning factor that makes people stop and pay attention. And for Biana Vacker, all of that comes together perfectly, making her someone others often strive to emulate—whether it be through their clothes, hairstyle, makeup, or shoes. (One notable exception is Sophie Foster, whose distaste for attention often results in her resisting Biana’s makeover suggestions.) And while some may consider such things to be trivial or frivolous, there’s something to be said for Biana’s ability to fearlessly face down giant mutant beasts or angry ogre kings, or any of the other terrifying situations she’s found herself in, and then swipe on some of her favorite lip gloss and put on her frilliest, fanciest gown like nothing happened. In a way, it’s kind of inspiring—and an excellent reminder that when it comes to emulating Biana’s style, the most important element is staying true to who you are.

                                        <b>AN ILLUSION OF SAFETY:</b> Up until recently, the Lost Cities were always seen as a place of comfort and peace—a world that didn’t need armies or police like so many of the other intelligent species rely on. And yet, Biana’s father (Alden Vacker) added a massive glowing fence around the entire perimeter of his property(Everglen), with bars designed to absorb light and prevent anyone from being able to light leap in. Which surely must have made for an interesting upbringing. On the one hand, his children were constantly being assured that everything was fine and there was no reason to worry. And yet, every time they stepped outside their house, they saw that they were living inside a gated fortress. Does that mean Biana and her brothers suspected some of the dangers that have now been proven to exist in our world? Could that possibly even explain why Biana and Fitz connected so easily to Sophie Foster and involved themselves in the conspiracies and chaos surrounding her? Or did they simply think their father preferred to control his visitors? It’s impossible to tell. But the gates have since been removed because of the illegal troll hive found on the property. And given the new instability of our world, it’s highly likely that the Vacker family misses them.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>THE BANE OF HER BODYGUARD’S EXISTENCE:</b> Like her friends, Biana was assigned a bodyguard when the Black Swan increased their security. But while most of the other bodyguard-protectee relationships have grown into unique friendships, it’s doubtful that Biana’s goblin bodyguard (Woltzer) feels any affection for her, the reason being that Biana has a bad habit of using her ability as a Vanisher to ditch poor Woltzer whenever she wants to do something he wouldn’t approve of— which also gets him in trouble with his supervisor (Sandor). To be fair, this has also meant that Woltzer has suffered far fewer injuries than the goblins guarding Biana’s friends—but that’s likely not why Biana sneaks away, so she probably doesn’t deserve credit for it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>MARKED BY BATTLE:</b> Biana is unfortunately not the only member of the Black Swan—nor the only one of her friends—to be seriously wounded during their altercations with the Neverseen. But Biana does bear a much larger souvenir of her injuries, in the form of noticeable scars on her arms, chest, neck, shoulders, and back. The injuries occurred when Biana went after Vespera by herself. (Evidently, her ability to vanish allowed her to sneak away during one of Vespera’s speeches.) It took her friends a while to catch up to her, and when they did, they found Biana unconscious and bleeding in a pile of jagged, broken glass. Apparently, Vespera had thrown Biana through one of the mirrors she used for her illusions—and records indicate that Vespera may have even intended for Biana to be scarred by the process and later braggedabout that intention to Biana’s friends. Perhaps she thought that a girl known for her flawless beauty wouldn’t be able to handle any new imperfections—and Biana did, at first, appear to be choosing clothes that hid the marks. But with time, she seems to have grown comfortable with her new skin, and now proudly wears gowns and tunics that leave her scars on display. (It should also be noted that some of Biana’s returned confidence may stem from her use of one of Elwin’s Emotional Support Stuffed Animals—a stuffed yeti apparently named Lady Sassyfur.) And while some may notice Biana’s scars and wonder what could have caused the injuries, no one would ever claim that Biana isn’t as stunning as ever. In fact, the scars might make Biana even more striking, testifying to a level of strength, confidence, and fierceness that few are able to claim.

                                        <b>A VALIANT REGENT:</b> In what may turn out to be Biana’s boldest step out of her brothers’ shadows, she was chosen by the Council to be a member of Team Valiant, and is now one of the youngest Regents in the nobility. As a result, she can proudly claim the title of “Lady.” (Some reports indicate that Biana likes to tease her brother Fitz and force him to call her “Lady Biana”—but those rumors cannot be confirmed.)
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>THE VACKER LEGACY:</b> Biana’s brother Alvar’s crimes are unfortunately common knowledge—as is his claim that he joined the Neverseen because of “the Vacker legacy.” And there are many theories as to what he may have meant by that phrase—as well as certain truths that Alvar managed to expose before his most recent disappearance (the illegal troll hive hidden at Everglen, for example). But like many in our world, Biana doesn’t appear to be convinced that she has the full understanding of what exactly the “Vacker legacy” is and seems determined to learn—though it’s unclear what risks she’s willing to take in order to find the whole truth.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        <b>FINAL NOTE:</b> It’s often been said, “Watch out for the Vanishers,” and Biana seems to be living proof of the adage. It’s difficult to tell exactly what role she plans to play—or if her ever-increasing boldness will lead her to ruin. But Biana’s definitely one to watch—assuming we can see her.
